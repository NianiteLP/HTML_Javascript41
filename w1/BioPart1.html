<!--My 2 paragraph Biography-->
<p>My name is<b> Antonio Carone. My nickname is AJ, but you can call me by whichever you prefer.</b> As for things about myself, I am an extremely <i>shy person</i> when it comes to people who I don't know very well, but if you were to ask any of my closest friends or family, they'd tell you that I am the loudest person around. I strive to be a very calm, cool and collected person, as well as extremely respectful to other people, and their opinions. I get along very well with children, as I was almost always babysitting before I moved into the dorm. I excel at<strong> math</strong>, but unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Language Arts because I was never good at writing essays like <em> some of the other people in my family.</em> My most valuable possession would be my deck of cards, because it brought me large amounts of joy learning how to do card manipulation. I was adopted by my grandparents in December of 2018. My favorite candy is Reeseâ€™s Peanut Butter Cups. My favorite videogame of all time would have to be Pokemon Diamond, as it was the first game I was able to purchase with my own money, and it would also be the first game that I had beaten on my own, without outside assistance from anyone else.</p>
