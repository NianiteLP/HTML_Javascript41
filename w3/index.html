            <p>For the third, (and hopefully final) Bio paragraph I will be talking about my personal experiences of school. When I was very young, I was one of the kids who always looked forward to school. I was always on time, I was friendly with everyone, and I always put in all of my effort. I was particularly good at math. Art, on the other hand, was never particularly my strong suit. unfortunately, I wasn't blessed with the hands of a surgeon. I have fairly slight tremors in my hands, so whenever I try to draw or write, it would come out sloppy. But of course, as any child does, I hit the age where school wasn't nearly as much of a concern for me as my free time. Then, I found NEIT through a college fair, and it made me genuinely excited to be in school again, because I felt like I finally got to learn what I wanted to, and that I wasn't forced into taking classes that I didn't want to take.</p>
